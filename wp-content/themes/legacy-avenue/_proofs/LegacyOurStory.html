				<p>For Jesus Pineda, finance wasn’t his first career choice, but it feels as though it may have been his calling.</p>
				<p>He often jokes that while he started his career in 2009, he sold his first policy at 12 years old. During that time, Jesus’ mother had a life insurance agent come to their home. And, because his mother didn’t speak English, Jesus translated as the man sold her $250,000 worth of term life insurance. </p>
				<p>So, you see, it is in his very nature to bring a high level of care, patience and compassion to Legacy Avenue clients.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="hero-column">
				<p>With every interaction, Jesus and his assistant, Leanna, strive to foster a welcoming, intimate environment; one of attentiveness, guidance and connection. They understand that finances, in many cases, equate to a certain level of strain and uncertainty. With a multitude of options, a constantly shifting economy and overly complicated jargon, clients can feel isolated and lost along their financial journey, especially with large, impersonal financial firms.</p>
				<p>As with his mother so many years ago, Jesus continues to translate the world of finance to clients, no matter their challenges or experience level, in a simplified, easy-to-understand way that promotes confidence, provides individual solutions and delivers peace of mind.</p>

				<h3>Jesus<br>
				PINEDA<span class="member-title">Financial Advisor</span></h3>
				<p><b>For over a decade,</b> Jesus has been helping clients crystalize their personal, business and financial goals. But, he didn’t start out in finance. A Peoria native, Jesus attended ASU (Arizona State), majoring in Psychology. It wasn’t until he took a job at a bank that the world of finance opened up to him. Now he couldn’t imagine it any other way, finding great satisfaction in connecting with clients to help them feel secure in their financial journey. </p>
			
				<p>Now, as much as Jesus enjoys working with clients, there is nothing more important to him than family. Married in 2009, he and his wife, Amanda, have four amazing children and spend much of their time on family outings, going to sporting events (Go Sun Devils!), or just enjoying each others company in and around their home.</p>

				<p>Leanna, like Jesus, didn’t start out in finance, but with her years of experience in the service industry, she has become an invaluable part of the Legacy Avenue team. Her energy, enthusiasm and friendly demeanor are positively infectious, showing just how much she thrives on helping people.</p>
				<p>Also an Arizona native, Leanna enjoys staying active with her children, spending much of their weekend time together exploring Arizona through activities like: camping, hiking, and paddle boarding.</p>
